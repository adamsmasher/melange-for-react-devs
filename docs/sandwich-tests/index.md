# Sandwich Tests

One day over drinks at the local bar, Madame Jellobutter tearfully recounts to
you how her previous venture, Unicorn BBQ, failed in part because of a terribly
buggy and crashy website. It was so traumatizing that she still has nightmares
about that website to this day! After the conversation, you decide to write some
unit tests.

## Install `melange-fest` via opam

After asking around in the `#melange` channel of the [Reason Discord
chatroom](https://melange.re/v3.0.0/community.html#community), you get a
recommendation from user MonadicFanatic1984 to try out
[melange-fest](https://github.com/jchavarri/melange-fest), a library that allows
you to write tests in OCaml and run them in [Node test
runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#test-runner). You decide to give it a
shot!

Run this from your project's root directory:

```shell
opam install melange-fest
```

Once that finishes, run `opam list` to see all the opam packages you've
installed in your *opam switch* (more on that later). Scroll down to the entry
for `melange-fest` and you should see something like this:

```
melange-fest    0.1.0   A minimal test framework for Melange using Node test runner
```

Open `melange-for-react-devs.opam` and add a corresponding entry in the
`depends` section for `melange-fest`:

```
depends: [
  "ocaml" {>= "5.1.1"}
  "reason" {>= "3.10.0"}
  "dune" {>= "3.8"}
  "melange" {>= "3.0.0-51"}
  "reason-react" {>= "0.14.0"}
  "reason-react-ppx" {>= "0.14.0"}
  "opam-check-npm-deps" {with-test} # todo: use with-dev-setup once opam 2.2 is out
  "ocaml-lsp-server" {with-test} # todo: use with-dev-setup once opam 2.2 is out
  "dot-merlin-reader" {with-test} # todo: use with-dev-setup once opam 2.2 is out
  "odoc" {with-doc}
  "melange-fest" {>= "0.1"} // [!code ++]
]
```

Note that the version number might not be `0.1` when you run `opam list`. If
it's different, just use that version number instead.

Now if we want to install this project on another computer, we don't need to
manually install `melange-fest`; it will be installed along with all the other
dependencies when we run `opam install . --deps-only`[^1] (this is already done for
you when you run `npm run init`).

::: warning

Currently, `melange-fest` isn't yet available in the [opam package
repository](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/), but this will be fixed soon.

:::

## Opam switch

An [opam switch](https://ocaml.org/docs/opam-switch-introduction) is an isolated
OCaml environment, similar to Python's
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/)[^2]. You can list all the opam switches on
your computer by running

```shell
opam switch
```

The output will look something like this:

```
#  switch                     compiler                   description
â†’  ~/melange-for-react-devs   ocaml-base-compiler.5.1.1  ~/melange-for-react-devs
   default                    ocaml.5.1.0                default

[NOTE] Current switch has been selected based on the current directory.
       The current global system switch is default.
```

As implied by `[NOTE]`, you don't need to manually set the opam switch for your
project, the switch is set based on your current working directory[^3].

## First test

Add a new file `src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.re` and add a simple test
to it:

<<< SandwichTests.re#first-test

You should get this error:

```
File "docs/burger-tests/SandwichTests.re", line 2, characters 0-9:
2 | Fest.test("Item.Sandwich.toEmoji", () =>
    ^^^^^^^^^
Error: Unbound module Fest
```

In order to use a library, you must add it to the `libraries` field of the
`melange.emit` stanza in your `dune` file:

```clj{3}
(melange.emit
 (target output)
 (libraries reason-react melange-fest)
 (preprocess
  (pps melange.ppx reason-react-ppx))
 (module_systems es6)
 (runtime_deps
  (glob_files *.css)))
```

## Opening a module

We'll be adding several more tests to this file, and it'll quickly become
tiresome to have to write `Fest.test`, `Fest.expect`, and `Fest.equal` all the
time.

The easiest way to save typing is by using a module alias:

<<< SandwichTests.re#module-alias

However, because `SandwichTests` is a module for tests and `Fest` only contains
testing-related functions, it's reasonable to
[open](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/module#opening-modules) the `Fest`
module and make all its functions available inside the scope of the
`SandwichTests` module:

<<< SandwichTests.re#open-fest

::: warning

In most cases, `open` should not be used at the toplevel of a module. It usually
makes more sense to use a [local
open](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/module#local-opens) which makes
all the functions of the opened module available inside the scope of a function
or submodule.

:::

## Compile with `.mjs` extension

Now that your `SandwichTests.re` compiles, try running the outputted `.js` file
in Node:

```shell
node _build/default/src/order-confirmation/output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.js
```

You'll probably see this error:

```
(node:68498) Warning: To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
/home/fhsu/work/melange-for-react-devs/_build/default/src/order-confirmation/output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.js:3
import * as Assert from "assert";
^^^^^^

SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

Recent versions of Node support [ECMAScript
modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#introduction), but Node uses [CommonJS
modules](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules) by
default. Node automatically treats `.mjs` files as ECMAScript modules, so you
can change the `module_systems` field of your `melange.emit` stanza to use the
`.mjs` extension:

```clj{6}
(melange.emit
 (target output)
 (libraries reason-react melange-fest)
 (preprocess
  (pps melange.ppx reason-react-ppx))
 (module_systems (es6 mjs))
 (runtime_deps
  (glob_files *.css)))
```

Now rebuild and run the test on the newly-generated `SandwichTests.mjs` file:

```shell
npm run build
node _build/default/src/order-confirmation/output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs
```

The tests should run successfully this time!

Since you've changed the extension of your generated JavaScript files to `.mjs`,
you must also change the reference in `src/order-confirmation/index.html`:

```html{7}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Melange for React Devs</title>
    <script type="module" src="../../_build/default/src/order-confirmation/output/src/order-confirmation/Index.mjs"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Run tests through Dune

It's a good idea to let Dune [run your
tests](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html), because Dune will
optimize your test runs by only running the tests that need to run. In addition,
Dune can conveniently execute all your tests with a single command:

```shell
opam exec -- dune build @melange @runtest
```

This tells Dune to build everything that has the aliases `@melange` and
`@runtest`. In Dune, an
[alias](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/aliases.html) is a build
target that doesn't correspond to a specific file. In practice, it's a way to
group related stanzas under a common name. When we refer to aliases, we write an
`@` in front of them, because that's how they're referenced on the command line.
[By default](https://melange.re/v3.0.0/build-system.html#building-the-project),
all `melange.emit` stanzas are attached to the `@melange` alias.

To save ourselves from having to type the above command repeatedly, add a new
npm script to `package.json`:

```json
"test": "npm run build -- @runtest --no-buffer"
```

We don't need to include the `@melange` alias in this script because it's
already referenced in the `build` script. We add `--no-buffer` at the end of the
command so that the output from Node test runner will retain its colors.

## Add `rule` for running tests

Right now, running `npm run test` won't run any tests, because we first need to
add a [rule stanza](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#rule)
which runs the code generated from `SandwichTests.re`. Add this to your
`src/order-confirmation/dune` file:

```clj
(rule
 (alias runtest)
 (action
  (run time node ./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs)))
```

Breaking it down:

- [`rule`](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#rule) is a
  stanza that "tells Dune how to generate a specific set of files from a
  specific set of dependencies". While this is technically correct, in this
  case, no files are generated and what we are really interested in is the side
  effects of the `action` field (described below).
- `(alias runtest)` attaches this rule to the alias `@runtest`
- [`action`](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/actions/index.html)
  is a required field of the `rule` stanza and is used to run commands.
  - The
    [`run`](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/actions/run.html)
    field is used to execute a program. In this case, it runs `node` on the
    `SandwichTests.mjs` file and `time`s how long it takes.
  - The default working directory for a rule is the mirrored directory in
    `_build` that corresponds to the directory where the rule is located. Since
    this rule is defined in `src/order-confirmation/dune`, the working directory
    for it is `_build/default/src/order-confirmation`. Therefore the full path
    of the file is

    ```
    _build/default/src/order-confirmation/output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs
    ```

Run `npm run test` to see your test being run through Dune.

::: tip

Rules are the true building blocks of Dune. A stanza like `melange.emit` is
really just shorthand for a series of related rules. See [The Dune Mental
Model](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/explanation/mental-model.html) for
a good explanation of this.

:::

## `deps` field

Change `SandwichTests.re` so that the test fails:

<<< SandwichTests.re#broken-test

Run `npm run test` again and... nothing happens. Dune won't re-run the test
because we didn't add any dependencies to our rule. We need to add a
`deps` field:

```clj{3-5,7}
(rule
 (alias runtest)
 (deps
  Item.re
  (:input ./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs))
 (action
  (run time node %{input})))
```

This `deps` field has two values:

- `Item.re` makes the rule depend on the `Item.re` file. This means that if
  `Item.re` changes after the last successful test run, then running `npm run
  test` will cause this test rule to run its `action` again.
- `(:input ./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs)` defines a new
  [variable](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/variables.html#variables)
  named `input` and binds it to the path
  `./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs`.

Inside the action, we can reference the variable using `%{input}` (the name of
the variable `input` enclosed by `%{` and `}`).

See [Dependency
Specification](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/dependency-spec.html)
for the full lowdown on dependencies in Dune.

We didn't have to use a variable here, but the alternative would've been to
write the same path two times:

```clj{5,7}
(rule
 (alias runtest)
 (deps
  Item.re
  ./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs)
 (action
  (run time node ./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs)))
```

Run `npm run test` to see that your test runs. It fails, but you can fix it and
run `npm run test` again. After the test succeeds, running `npm run test` won't
cause any tests to run until either `Item.re` or `SandwichTests.mjs` is
changed.

Sugoi! You now have a module for testing sandwich-related logic. In the next
chapter, we'll focus on adding tests for burger-related logic.

## Overview

- An opam switch is an isolated OCaml environment
- Use `opam install` to install third-party libraries into the current opam
  switch
- After you install a library, you should:
  - Add it to your `.opam` file so that it will be installed with all your other
    dependencies the next time you run `opam install . --deps-only`
  - Add it to the `libraries` field of your `melange.emit` stanza so your code
    can use it
- `melange-fest` is a testing library that allows you write tests in OCaml and
  run them in Node test runner
- You can `open` a module to make all its functions available in the current
  scope
- Set the value of `module_systems` to `(es6 mjs)` to make Melange generate
  `.mjs` files that are treated by Node as ECMASCript modules
- Dune has built-in support for tests
  - Execute all tests by running `opam exec -- dune build @runtest`
  - Only re-run succeeding tests when dependencies changed since the last time
    the test was run
- The `rule` stanza can be used to specify your tests
  - Use the `alias` field to attach the rule to the `@runtest` alias
  - Use the `deps` field to specify the dependencies for the rule
    - Use variables inside `deps` so you don't have to type a path twice
  - Use the `action` field to specify the command that launches the test

## Exercises

<b>1.</b> Test all possible outputs for `Item.Sandwich.toEmoji` using
`Fest.deepStrictEqual` (see [`node:assert`
docs](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) if you're not familiar with this
function).

::: details Hint 1

Create an array of sandwiches:

<<< SandwichTests.re#array-of-sandwiches

:::

::: details Hint 2

Use `Js.Array.map` and pass two arrays of strings to `Fest.deepStrictEqual`.

:::

::: details Solution

A comprehensive test of `Item.Sandwich.toEmoji` might look like this:

<<< SandwichTests.re#test-to-emoji

:::

<b>2.</b> Add a new file for `BurgerTests.re` containing this code:

<<< @/../src/sandwich-tests/BurgerTests.re

Add a new `rule` stanza in your `dune` file so that this test can be run via
`npm run test`.

::: details Solution

The `rule` stanza for `BurgerTests.re` is very similar to the existing
rule we have for `SandwichTests.re`:

```clj
(rule
 (alias runtest)
 (deps
  Item.re
  (:input ./output/src/order-confirmation/BurgerTests.mjs))
 (action
  (run time node %{input})))
```

:::

<b>3.</b> Refactor `Item.Sandwich.toPrice` to accept a `Js.Date.t`:

<<< Item.re#to-price

Fix the resulting compilation error in `Item.toPrice` and add a unit test to
check that the date-dependent logic for Turducken sandwiches works as expected.

::: details Hint

Use
[Js.Date.makeWithYMD](https://melange.re/v3.0.0/api/re/melange/Js/Date/#val-makeWithYMD)
and `Js.Array.map` to generate a whole week's worth of dates. Here's a [relevant
playground
example](https://melange.re/v3.0.0/playground/?language=Reason&code=bGV0IGRhdGVzID0KICBbfDEuLCAyLiwgMy4sIDQuLCA1LiwgNi4sIDcufF0KICB8PiBKcy5BcnJheS5tYXAofmY9ZGF0ZSA9PgogICAgICAgSnMuRGF0ZS5tYWtlV2l0aFlNRCh%2BeWVhcj0yMDI0Liwgfm1vbnRoPTAuLCB%2BZGF0ZSkKICAgICApOwoKZGF0ZXMKfD4gSnMuQXJyYXkuZm9yRWFjaCh%2BZj1kYXRlID0%2BCiAgICAgSnMubG9nMihKcy5EYXRlLmdldERheShkYXRlKSwgSnMuRGF0ZS50b1N0cmluZyhkYXRlKSkKICAgKTsK&live=off).

[^1]: The `--deps-only` option tells `opam install` to only install the
    dependencies and not the package. When you're developing an application and
    not a library, there is no package associated with your project.

[^2]: In this book, we only use opam's [local
    switches](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-local-switches/), which are in
    practice similar to Node project directories containing a `package.json`
    file. But in general, an opam switch doesn't have to be associated with a
    project directory.

[^3]: A shell hook is responsible for setting the current opam switch depending
    on what directory you're in. The shell hook is typically installed when you
    run `opam init`. Just respond with `y` when it asks

    ```
    Do you want opam to modify ~/.profile?
    ```

    Note that it may ask to modify `~/.zshrc` or some other file; the name of
    the file is system-dependent.
