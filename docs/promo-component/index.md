# Promo Component

Madame Jellobutter has been pretty impressed with your work so far, so she sends
you on an all-expenses paid trip to an [OCaml
Hackathon](https://fun-ocaml.com/). You learn a lot, make several new friends,
and you even meet MonadicFanatic1984 in person![^1] You're extremely psyched to
start applying the things you learn during the hackathon.

## `RR` utility module

While having lunch during the hackathon, fellow attendee FunctorPunk[^2]
suggests that you create a dedicated module for your ReasonReact-related helper
functions. Add a new file `RR.re`:

<<< RR.re#initial-functions

These are all functions we used before, but now they're in one handy place, and
we added documentation comments to them. Note that you can now delete the
`Format` module, since its `currency` function is now in `RR`.

## Documentation comment markup language

In a couple of the documentation comments, we used square brackets (`[]`):

```text
/** Alias for [React.string] */
```

Whatever is inside the brackets gets rendered in a monospace source code font.
This is one example of the [markup
language](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/ocamldoc.html#ss:ocamldoc-formatting)
used inside documentation comments.

## `Promo` component

Add new file `Promo.re`:

<<< Promo.re#first-version

For now, it just shows an input that allows the user to enter a promo code.

## `React.useReducer`

Another neat trick you learn from FunctorPunk is that you can substitute
[React.useState](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/usestate-hook)[^3]
with
[React.useReducer](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/usereducer-hook):

<<< Promo.re#use-reducer{3-4,9}

The advantage of this is that you can update state by passing a value instead of
a callback. To make it even nicer, we can also rename `dispatch` to `setCode`
and use function chaining inside the `onChange` callback:

<<< Promo.re#set-code{3-4,9}

## `RR.useStateValue` helper function

We can add a new helper function `RR.useStateValue` that allows us to more
easily use this pattern:

<<< RR.re#use-state-value

The state setup code in `Promo` then becomes very simple:

```reason
let (code, setCode) = // [!code --]
    React.useReducer((_state, newState) => newState, ""); // [!code --]
let (code, setCode) = RR.useStateValue(""); // [!code ++]
```

## Add `Promo` to `Index`

The `Promo` component isn't finished yet, but let's add it to `Index` so that we
can see how it looks as we're building it:

<<< Index.re#make{4-5}

We know that, sooner or later, we must pass `items` and `date` to `Promo`, so we
just do it now. However, this breaks the build because `Promo` doesn't yet
define those props.

## Temporarily ignore props

We can quickfix it by adding the `~items` and `~date` props to `Promo.make` and
then immediately `ignore`ing them in the body of the function:

<<< Promo.re#ignore

A more concise way to temporarily ignore props is to use the `as` keyword in the
function argument list:

```reason
[@react.component]
let make = (~items as _: list(Item.t), ~date as _: Js.Date.t) => {
```

Here we rename `~items` to `_`, effectively ignoring it, and also do the same
for `~date`. Note that this renaming only extends to the scope of the function
itself.

## `styled-ppx` package

During dinner, you meet a cool human named Dave who introduces you to
[styled-ppx](https://ocaml.org/p/styled-ppx), the package he authored to allow
writing type-safe CSS inside OCaml. Itâ€™s inspired by
[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), and also uses Emotion under the
hood.

To install `styled-ppx`, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install @emotion/css
opam install styled-ppx
```

After those commands finish, see what version of `styled-ppx` was installed by
running `opam list`:

```text{4}
...
stdune                3.15.2      Dune's unstable standard library
stringext             1.6.0       Extra string functions for OCaml
styled-ppx            0.56.0      Type-safe styled components for ReScript and Melange
time_now              v0.16.0     Reports the current time
topkg                 1.0.7       The transitory OCaml software packager
...
```

Add `"styled-ppx" {>= "0.56.0"}` to the `depends` section of your `.opam` file.
(Adjust the version based on what you see  from `ocaml list`.)

To make sure that the version of `@emotion/css` you got from npm is compatible
with the version of `styled-ppx` you got from opam, run

```bash
npm run check-npm-deps
```

You should see some output like this:

```text
Ok: opam package "reason-react.0.14.0" requires npm package: "react-dom" with constraint "^18.0.0", version installed: "18.2.0"
Ok: opam package "reason-react.0.14.0" requires npm package: "react" with constraint "^18.0.0", version installed: "18.2.0"
Ok: opam package "styled-ppx.0.56.0" requires npm package: "@emotion/css" with constraint ">=11.0.0", version installed: "11.11.2"
```

::: warning

The output from `npm run check-npm-deps` might not show anything for
`styled-ppx` yet, that should be fixed soon.

:::

## Add styles to `Promo`

Try adding a style to `Promo`'s `form` element:

```reason
<form
  className=[%cx {|display: flex; flex-direction: column;|}] // [!code ++]
  onSubmit={evt => evt |> React.Event.Form.preventDefault}>
```

You'll get a compilation error:

```
File "src/order-confirmation/Promo.re", line 6, characters 16-18:
6 |     className=[%cx {|display: flex; flex-direction: column;|}]
                    ^^
Error: Uninterpreted extension 'cx'.
```

`styled-ppx` is installed, but it can't be used until the `libraries` and
`preprocess/pps` stanzas of your `dune` file have been updated:

```dune
(libraries reason-react melange-fest styled-ppx.emotion)
 (preprocess
  (pps melange.ppx reason-react-ppx styled-ppx))
```

For reference:

- Adding `styled-ppx` in `preprocess/pps` enables the `%cx` extension node
- Adding `styled-ppx.css` in `libraries` enables the `Css` and `CssJs` modules

If you run `npm run serve', you'll see that the styles are now applied.


## `Promo.Style` submodule

Although you can use the `%cx` extension node inline within your JSX, it's
usually a good idea to put all of them in a `Style` submodule within your
component module:

<<< Promo.re#style-submodule

Then update your JSX:

<<< Promo.re#updated-jsx{2,5}

Using a `Style` submodule encourages reuse of class names and tends to make your
JSX more readable.

## `styled-ppx` is type-safe

The strings we pass to the `%cx` extension must be valid CSS and each property
must have a valid value. To see this in action, change the value of the
`flex-direction` property:

```css
flex-direction: column; // [!code --]
flex-direction: col; // [!code ++]
```

You'll get this compilation error:

```text
File "src/order-confirmation/Promo.re", lines 3-4, characters 37-43:
2 | ...................
3 | .................;
4 |     flex-direction: col.
Error: Property 'flex-direction' has an invalid value: 'col'
```

Change some of the other properties to invalid values and see what happens.

## Install `vscode-styled-ppx` extension

Now that we're writing our CSS inside our OCaml code, the CSS is no longer
highlighted. Fortunately, it's not an issue if for VS Code users, just install
the [vscode-styled-ppx
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx).
