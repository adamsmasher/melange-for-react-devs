# Promo Component

Madame Jellobutter has been pretty impressed with your work so far, so she sends
you on an all-expenses paid trip to an [OCaml
Hackathon](https://fun-ocaml.com/). You learn a lot, make several new friends,
and you even meet MonadicFanatic1984 in person![^1] After you return from the
trip, you're excited to improve your development experience by upgrading your
tools.

## `styled-ppx` package

At the hackathon, you meet a cool human named Dave who introduces you to his
[styled-ppx](https://ocaml.org/p/styled-ppx) OCaml package. It lets you write
type-safe CSS inside OCaml! Itâ€™s inspired by
[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) (and uses Emotion under the
hood).

To install `styled-ppx`, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install @emotion/css
opam install styled-ppx
```

After those commands finish, see what version of `styled-ppx` was installed by
running `opam list`:

```text{4}
...
stdune                3.15.2      Dune's unstable standard library
stringext             1.6.0       Extra string functions for OCaml
styled-ppx            0.56.0      Type-safe styled components for ReScript and Melange
time_now              v0.16.0     Reports the current time
topkg                 1.0.7       The transitory OCaml software packager
...
```

Add `"styled-ppx" {>= "0.56.0"}` to the `depends` section of your `.opam` file.
(Adjust the version based on what you see  from `ocaml list`.)

## `RR` utility module

While having lunch during the hackathon, fellow hackathon attendee
FunctorPunk[^2] suggests that you create a dedicated module for your
ReasonReact-related helper functions. Add a new file `RR.re`:

<<< RR.re#initial-functions

These are all functions we used before, but now they're in one handy place, and
we added documentation comments to them. Note the use of square brackets (`[]`):

```text
/** Alias for [React.string] */
```

Whatever is inside the brackets gets rendered in a monospace source code font.
This is one example of the [markup
language](https://v2.ocaml.org/releases/5.0/manual/ocamldoc.html#ss:ocamldoc-formatting)
used inside documentation comments.

## `Promo` component

Add new file `Promo.re`:

<<< Promo.re#first-version

## Rename arguments using `as` keyword

This is our first time seeing the `as` keyword, which is used to rename function
arguments (among other things). It's equivalent to doing this:

```reason
[@react.component]
let make = (~items: list(Item.t), ~date: Js.Date.t) => {
  let _items = items;
  let _date = date;
```

The renamed variables are only visible within the function, the caller of the
function must still use the original names for the arguments.

If we don't rename `~items` and `~dates` arguments, the compiler will give us
the "unused variable items" error. So we temporarily rename them to names
starting with underscores so the compiler won't complain about their non-usage.

## `React.useReducer`

One of the neat things you learn from FunctorPunk is that
