# Cram Tests

Now that you have a set of unit tests for sandwich-related logic, you realize it
would be nice to have some unit tests for burger-related logic as well. But
adding a new command to your `test` npm script doesn't feel like The OCaml Way,
so you hop on the [Reason Discord
chatroom](https://melange.re/v3.0.0/community.html#community) to ask for advice.
MonadicFanatic1984 once again comes to your aid and points you toward *cram
tests*.

## Cram tests

A [cram test](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/cram.html) is
essentially a test that runs a command inside a sandbox, then compares the
output with some expected output. Dune has built-in support for cram tests,
which means:

- You can specify dependencies for a cram test inside your `dune` file
- Cram tests are only run when their dependencies change
- When you update cram tests, causing their output to change, you can easily
  *promote* the latest output to become the new expected output
- You can run all tests using a single command that doesn't need to refer to
  individual tests

Before you can write your first cram test, you need to enable cram tests by
adding this to your `dune-project` file:

```dune
; Enable cram tests
(cram enable)
```

## `cram` stanza

To add dependencies for your cram tests, you need to add a [cram
stanza](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#cram-stanza) to
`src/order-confirmation/dune`:

```dune
(cram
 (deps ./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs))
```

This configuration tells Dune two things:

- Copy `./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs` into the sandbox
  directory
- Whenever `SandwichTests.re` (the immediate dependency for
  `./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs`) changes, rebuild and
  re-run all the cram tests defined in the same directory as this `dune` file

Note that we cannot use the same path to `SandwichTests.mjs` as we would if we
were running this from the root directory of our project, because cram tests are
run inside a sandbox directory (more on that later).

## Add `tests.t` file

Cram tests are specified inside `.t` files. Add a new file
`src/order-confirmation/tests.t`:

```cram
Sandwich tests
  $ node ./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs
```

Note that this is the same path we specified inside the `cram/deps` field.

To run tests, execute

```shell
dune build @runtest
```

Here,
[@runtest](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/aliases.html#runtest)
is a built-in *alias*. The above command builds whatever is needed by the tests
and then runs the tests.

## Aliases

A Dune [alias](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/aliases.html) is
a virtual build target that other build targets can attach to. You can refer to
aliases by name in build commands (like the one above), to build a specific
subset of your build targets. In commands, we need to put `@` in front of the
alias name to distinguish it from file names. Therefore when we refer to an
alias, we put an `@` in front, e.g. `@runtest`, `@melange`, etc.

::: tip

Cram tests are automatically attached to the `@runtest` alias, and
`melange.emit` stanzas are automatically attached to the `@melange` alias.

:::

## Promotion

After running `dune build @runtest`, you should be able to see the
output from the cram test you just added[^1]. However, this doesn't count as a
passing cram test, because this output can't be compared to the expected output.
Dune has a nice feature that lets you
[promote](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/promotion.html#promotion)
the latest output of a cram test to become the expected output:

```shell
dune promote
```

The above command updates your `src/order-confirmation/tests.t` cram test file,
which now looks something like this:

<<< tests{cram}

The part underneath the command is the expected output of the command.

## Add `npm` scripts

Instead of typing `dune` commands over and over, let's add the relevant `npm`
scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json
"test": "npm run build -- @runtest",
"test:watch": "npm run build -- @runtest --watch",
"promote": "npm run dune -- promote"
```

Since JSON doesn't support comments, you can optionally add some lines to the
`scriptsComments` section of `package.json` to explain what each command does:

```json
"test": "# Run the tests",
"test:watch": "# Watch files and re-run tests",
"promote": "# Promote most recent output to expected output"
```

Run `npm run test` to check that it works.

## Sanitize cram test output

The cram test still doesn't succeed, but now it's because the most recent output
and the expected output don't match:

<<< diff{diff}

The problem is that the recorded durations for individual unit tests is differs
on each test run. Therefore we must
[sanitize](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#test-output-sanitation)
the test output, i.e. remove the parts that are non-deterministic. Update your
cram test command:

```shell
$ node ./output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs | sed '/duration_ms/d'
```

Now the output of the command is piped to `sed '/duration_ms/d'`, which removes
all the lines containing the string `duration_ms`.

Follow these steps to achieve your first successful cram test run:

1. Run `npm run test`
1. It fails because the expected output still contains the `duration_ms` lines
1. Run `npm run promote` to promote the latest output to the expected output
1. Run `npm run test`
1. You should see no test output

No test output means it succeeded. Somewhat unintuitively, when cram tests
succeed, they remain silent![^2]

## Sandbox

All cram tests execute in a
[sandbox](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#sandboxing). What
goes into the sandbox directory is determined by the value of the `cram/deps`
field in your `dune` file. Let's write an explorative cram test that allows us
to peek inside the sandbox. First, install the [tree-node-cli
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tree-node-cli):

```shell
npm install --save-dev tree-node-cli
```

Then add a new cram test to `src/order-confirmation/tests.t`:

```cram
See all the files inside the sandbox
  $ npx tree
```

Now when you run `npm run test`, you'll see some output like this:

```diff
@@ -24,3 +24,8 @@ Sandwich tests

 See all the files inside the sandbox
   $ npx tree
+  cram-tests
+  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output
+      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
+          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cram-tests
+              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SandwichTests.mjs
```

The sandbox directory only contains a single file
`output/src/cram-tests/SandwichTests.mjs`. Add another explorative cram test:

```cram
Show detail of SandwichTests.mjs
  $ ls -la ./output/src/cram-tests/SandwichTests.mjs
```

The output should now look like this:

```diff

   $ npx tree

```

From this, you can see that `./output/src/cram-tests/SandwichTests.mjs` is
actually a symbolic link which links to the real file inside your build
directory, specifically this file:

```
_build/default/src/order-confirmation/output/src/order-confirmation/SandwichTests.mjs
```

`SandwichTests.mjs` being a symbolic link explains why you can run the test
successfully even when the rest of the `.mjs` files aren't present in the
sandbox directory.

## Better dependencies

There's a problem with the cram test dependencies. The cram test is re-run if
`SandwichTests.re` changes, but if `Item.re`, which `SandwichTests.re` depends
on, were to change, it wouldn't trigger a test re-run. To see this, make the
following change to `Item.Sandwich.toEmoji`:

```reason
let toEmoji = t =>
  Printf.sprintf(
    {js|ü•™(%s)|js},
    switch (t) {
    | Portabello => {js|üçÑ|js}
    | Ham => {js|üê∑|js}
    | Unicorn => {js|ü¶Ñ|js}
    | Turducken => {js|ü¶Éü¶Üüêì|js} // [!code --]
    | Turducken => {js|ü¶Éü¶Üüêìüí©|js} // [!code ++]
    },
  );
```

After running `npm run test`, you would expect a failing test, but that doesn't
happen. You have to add `(alias melange)` to `cram/deps`:

```dune
(cram
 (deps
  (alias melange)
  ./output/src/cram-tests/SandwichTests.mjs))
```

This adds the `Item.re` to the sandbox, but it doesn't cause the test to fail.
The proper fix is to instead add `(alias melange)` to `cram/deps`:

```dune
(cram
 (deps
  (alias melange)
  ./output/src/cram-tests/SandwichTests.mjs))
```

Now the test finally fails. The presence of `(alias melange)` means that all
build targets attached to the `@melange` alias are now dependencies for the cram
tests in this directory.

## `expand_aliases_in_sandbox` stanza

If you kept the `$ npx tree` cram test around, you'll observe that even though
all build targets attached to `@melange` are dependencies, they aren't copied
into the sandbox directory. You can change that behavior by adding the
[expand_aliases_in_sandbox
stanza](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#stanza-expand_aliases_in_sandbox)
to your `dune-project` file:

```dune
; Copy all build targets for an alias into the sandbox

(expand_aliases_in_sandbox)
```

Run `npm run test` again and you'll see that a lot of files have been copied
over to the sandbox directory. Since `SandwichTests.mjs` is a `@melange` build
target too, it actually no longer needs to be explicitly included in
`cram/deps`:

```
(cram
 (deps
  (alias melange)))
```

Fix the bug in `Item.re` and re-run `npm run test`. Your cram test should pass
once more.

::: warning

Using
[expand_aliases_in_sandbox](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#stanza-expand_aliases_in_sandbox)
is more convenient, but it may noticeably impact cram test performance. If you
feel your cram tests are too slow, you should remove it.

Fantastico! You've set up Dune cram tests to streamline the testing process. In
the next chapter, we'll add logic for promotional discounts.

## Overview

- A cram test runs a command inside a sandbox and compares the output of that
  command with some expected output
- Dune has extensive support for cram tests, including the ability to promote
  the latest output to become the expected output
- A `cram` stanza is used to specify dependencies for your cram tests
- Cram test files have the `.t` extension
- Aliases are virtual build targets that other build targets can be attached to
- Cram tests that produce nondeterministic output must have that be sanitized
- Cram tests execute in a sandbox
- For Melange projects, `(alias melange)` is generally the best dependency for
  your cram tests
- The `expand_aliases_in_sandbox` allows you to avoid having to put generated
  `.mjs` files in your cram test dependencies, at the cost of having slower cram
  tests

[^1]: You might notice that the output from the Node test runner looks different
    when run inside a cram test. That's because Note test runner uses different
    [test reporters](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#test-reporters) depending
    on whether you run it directly or through another process.

[^2]: A successful cram test won't print any output from the test, but you may
    see some logging that indicates that build targets were produced, e.g.

    ```shell
    refmt src/cram-tests/Item.re.ml
    ppx src/cram-tests/Item.re.pp.ml
    ocamldep src/cram-tests/.output.mobjs/melange__Item.impl.d
