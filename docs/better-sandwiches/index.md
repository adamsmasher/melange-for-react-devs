# Better Sandwiches

Cafe Emoji is a stunning success, despite the fact that all sandwiches have the
same filling of Mystery Meat‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. In order to offer her diners more variety,
Madame Jellobutter decides to add multiple types of sandwich to her menu.

Currently, your `src/order-confirmation/Item.re` looks something like this:

<<< @/../src/styling-with-css/Item.re

## `sandwich` variant type

To start, add a new variant type `sandwich` and then add that type as the
*argument* for the `Sandwich` constructor of `Item.t`:

<<< Item.re#sandwich-type{1-4,7}

You'll immediately get a compilation error inside the `Item.toPrice` function:

```
File "src/order-confirmation/Item.re", line 13, characters 2-12:
13 |   | Sandwich => 10.
         ^^^^^^^^
Error: The constructor Sandwich expects 1 argument(s),
       but is applied here to 0 argument(s)
```

This is easy to fix by adding a `sandwich` argument in the `Sandwich` branches
for both `Item.toPrice` and `Item.toEmoji`:

```reason
let toPrice =
  fun
  | Sandwich => 10. // [!code --]
  | Sandwich(sandwich) => 10. // [!code ++]
  | Burger => 15.
  | Hotdog => 5.;

let toEmoji =
  fun
  | Sandwich => {js|ü•™|js} // [!code --]
  | Sandwich(sandwich) => {js|ü•™|js} // [!code ++]
  | Burger => {js|üçî|js}
  | Hotdog => {js|üå≠|js};
```

Now there's a different error:

```
File "src/order-confirmation/Item.re", line 13, characters 13-20:
13 |   | Sandwich(sandwich) => 10.
                  ^^^^^^^^
Error (warning 27 [unused-var-strict]): unused variable sandwich.
```

## A valid use of wildcard

OCaml demands that we use variables we declare[^1], unless they begin with
underscore. So we can silence the error by renaming `sandwich` to `_sandwich`:

```reason
| Sandwich(_sandwich) => 10.
```

However, this essentially turns `_sandwich` into a wildcard, which is [generally
a bad idea](/order-confirmation/#wildcard-in-switch-expressions). The reality,
though, is that the warning against using wildcards is more a guideline than a
hard and fast rule. In this case, it's useful to temporarily use wildcards to
silence the compiler errors while we fill in the missing logic for
`Item.toPrice` and `Item.toEmoji`. Still, when the wildcard is meant to be
temporary, we can give it a more attention-grabbing name so it's less likely to
become permanent:

```reason
| Sandwich(_todo_please_use_this_sandwich) => 10.
```

## Update `Item.toPrice` function

The price of a sandwich should vary depending on the type of sandwich received
by `Item.toPrice`[^2]:

<<< Item.re#to-price-nested-switch

Actually, there's no need for the nested switch, as OCaml allows you to pattern
match into nested structures:

<<< Item.re#to-price-flat

## Combining branches in switch

Madame Jellobutter decides to upgrade her portabellos from canned mushrooms to
artisanal mushrooms lovingly grown by mustachioed hipsters on a local farm,
which increases the price of portabello sandwiches to $10. Now portabello and
ham sandwiches are the same price, so you update the `Item.toPrice` function
accordingly:

<<< Item.re#to-price-same-price{3}

We can combine the portabello and ham branches because they return the same
value:

<<< Item.re#to-price-combine{3-4}

Since the outer constructor `Sandwich` is the same in both branches, we can
combine them into a single branch:

<<< Item.re#to-price{3}

The power of pattern matching gives us both clarity and brevity. This is the
OCaml Way!

## Update `Item.toEmoji` function

`Item.toEmoji` should now return a combination of two emojis when it gets a
`Sandwich(_)` argument:

| Sandwich | Emoji |
| -------- | ----- |
| Portabello | ü•™(üçÑ) |
| Ham | ü•™(üê∑) |
| Unicorn | ü•™(ü¶Ñ) |

We can implement this using `Js.Array.joinWith`:

<<< Item.re#to-emoji-joinwith{3-13}

This touches on the issue of coding style for switch expressions. When possible,
put shorter branches before longer branches:

<<< Item.re#to-emoji-short-branch-first

## `{j||j}` quoted string literal

The approach using `Js.Array.joinWith` works, but readability could be improved
by using a [quoted string literal with the quoted string identifier
`j`](https://melange.re/v2.2.0/communicate-with-javascript/#strings):

<<< Item.re#to-emoji-j-string-literal{5-13}

`{j||j}` quoted string literals are similar to [template literals in
JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
except that they can only accept variables, not arbitrary expressions. Variables
that appear in `{j||j}` quoted string literals are implicitly converted to
strings, so they are not type safe and thus unsuitable for production code. See
the [exercises at the end of this chapter](#exercises) for more details.

Also note that unlike switch expressions, the `fun` syntax does not accept
multi-line expressions in branches unless you add `{}` around them.

::: warning

If you need to make a string literal that contains Unicode characters, use
`{js||js}`. You may be tempted to use `{j||j}` because it also supports Unicode
characters and it saves some keystrokes, but as explained above, it isn't
type-safe and is therefore less future-proof.

:::

## `Printf.sprintf`

The OCaml standard library provides a type-safe way to do string interpolation
in the form of the
[Printf.sprintf](https://melange.re/v2.2.0/api/re/melange/Stdlib/Printf/index.html#val-sprintf)
function:

<<< Item.re#to-emoji-sprintf

Unlike `{j||j}` quoted string literals, `Printf.sprintf` will not do implicit
string conversion.

## Bundling

An unfortunate downside of the `Printf` module is that using it can add a
surprising amount to your app's production bundle size. Let's generate a bundle
to see just how much of a difference it makes. However, since this is a
[multi-page app](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build#multi-page-app), Vite won't
automatically build bundles for `index.html` files that aren't in the project's
root directory. You must add a little extra configuration to `vite.config.js`:

```javascript{1,12-18}
import { resolve } from 'path'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { nodeResolve } from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [nodeResolve()],
  server: {
    watch: {
      ignored: ['**/_opam']
    }
  },
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        order_confirmation: resolve(__dirname, 'src/order-confirmation/index.html'),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Now run `make bundle` again and you should see some output like this:

```bash{5}
vite v5.0.11 building for production...
‚úì 61 modules transformed.
dist/src/order_confirmation/index.html         0.35 kB ‚îÇ gzip:  0.24 kB
dist/assets/order_confirmation-14ani3dg.css    0.27 kB ‚îÇ gzip:  0.18 kB
dist/assets/order_confirmation-2_8a7RSk.js   190.13 kB ‚îÇ gzip: 57.85 kB
‚úì built in 1.20s
```

You can see that the JS bundle for the Order Confirmation app is 190 kB. If you
change `Item.toEmoji` back to use `Js.Array.joinWith`, the bundle size will be
144 kB, about 46 kB smaller.

Frabjous! The order confirmation widget now supports more types of sandwiches.
In the next chapter, we'll see how to expand the options for burgers.

## Exercises

<b>1.</b> Madame Jellobutter wants to add another type of sandwich and she's
asked you for your input. Give it an appropriate price and find the most
suitable emoji(s) for it.

<b>2.</b> Change the logic of `Item.toPrice` so that the new sandwich you just
added is cheaper or more expensive *depending on the day of the week*.

::: details Hint 1

Look at the functions in the
[Js.Date](https://melange.re/v2.2.0/api/re/melange/Js/Date/) module.

::: details Hint 2

Use a `when` guard in the switch expression.

<b>3.</b> The following program uses `{j||j}` quoted string literals and has a
number of issues:

```reason
let compute = (a, b) => (a +. 10.) /. b;

// Rewrite using Printf.sprintf, limit result to 3 decimal places
let result = compute(40., 47.);
Js.log({j|result to 3 decimal places = $(result)|j});

// Rewrite using Printf.sprintf, don't print function
let result = compute(44. /* oops, forgot the second argument */);
Js.log({j|another result = $(result)|j});

// Rewrite using Printf.sprintf and print the individual fields of the object
let player: Js.t({..}) = {
  "name": "Wilbur",
  /* bonus: use the flag that makes long numbers more readable */
  "level": 9001234,
  "immortal": false,
};
Js.log({j|Player: $(player)|j});
```

Currently, it prints:

```
result to 3 decimal places = 1.0638297872340425
another result = function result$1(param) { return compute(44, param); }
Player: [object Object]
```

Use `Printf.sprintf` instead and improve the program as suggested by the
comments. You can edit the program interactively in [Melange

## Overview

- Variant constructors can contain arguments
- OCaml's pattern matching syntax makes your code more readable and concise
  - You can match to any level of nesting: `| A(B(C)) => 42`
  - There are many options for combining branches in switch expressions, e.g.
    - `| A => 42 | B => 42` becomes `| A | B => 42`
    - `| A(B) => 42 | A(C) => 42` becomes `| A(B | C) => 42`
- A valid use of wildcards in switch expressions is when you want to silence
  compiler errors while you fill in the logic for new branches in switch
  expressions
- `{j||j}` quoted string literals are similar to JavaScript's template literals,
  but they are not type safe and should be avoided in production code
- `Print.sprintf` is a type-safe function for string interpolation
- For Vite multi-page apps, you must add a little extra configuration to build
  bundles for `index.html` files not in the project's root directory

## Solutions

<b>1.</b> Add a new `Turducken` constructor to variant type `sandwich` and update
the `Item.toPrice` and `Item.toEmoji` functions accordingly:

<<< Item.re#item-turducken

Of course, you could've chosen a completely different sandwich, and that would be
just fine.

<b>2.</b> In the alternate dimension where the turducken sandwich was added,
Madame Jellobutter wants to do a promotion called "Turducken Tuesdays" where
turducken sandwiches become half-price on Tuesdays. To support this generous
discount, `Item.toPrice` needs to be updated like so:

<<< Item.re#to-price-turducken-tuesdays

Note that the `fun` syntax had to be abandoned, because the body of
`Item.toPrice` now consists of more than just a switch expression.

<b>3.</b> After replacing the `{j||j}` quoted string literals with
`Printf.sprintf` and fixing the various issues, you might end up with something
[like
